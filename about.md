<p class="lead">The Wonka Paper Reading Group is the internet-home of the <a href="http://peterwonka.net"> Research Group </a> at <a href="https://kaust.edu.sa"> KAUST </a>.</p>

The papers we choose to read and discuss are primarily in the area of Visual Computing, which often means they are diverse -  covering Geometric Modelling, Generative Modelling, Sampling, Semantic Segmentation and much more.

This blog is mostly to keep notes on papers we have read.
