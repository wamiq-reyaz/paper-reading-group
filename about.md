<p class="lead">The Wonka Paper Reading Group is the internet-home of the [Research Group](http://peterwonka.net) at [KAUST](https://kaust.edu.sa).</p>

The papers we choose to read and discuss are primarily in the area of Visual Computing, which often means they are diverse -  covering Geometric Modelling, Generative Modelling, Sampling, Semantic Segmentation and much more.

This blog is mostly to keep notes on papers we have read. 

<p class="lead">Code of Conduct.</p>

Read. Read. Read. <br/>
Ask Questions.
