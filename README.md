# Wonka Paper Reading Group

The Wonka Paper Reading Group is the internet-home of the Wonka Research Group at KAUST .

The papers we choose to read and discuss are primarily in the area of Visual Computing, which often means they are diverse - covering Geometric Modelling, Generative Modelling, Sampling, Semantic Segmentation and much more.

This blog is mostly to keep notes on papers we have read.
